# Hi there! I'm Arvin 😎

🎉 **Welcome to my GitHub lair!** 🎉

I'm Arvin, a seasoned **mobile app developer** with a penchant for all things **React Native** and **iOS/Android development**. I've been crafting code since before “there’s an app for that” was a thing. In my downtime, I reverse engineer apps (yes, I hack... ethically, of course 😇) and dive into cutting-edge tech because, well, why not?

## 🌱 Currently Growing My Powers In:

- Deep diving into mobile reverse engineering, because knowing an app's inner workings is just too much fun.
- Experimenting with AI/ML... who doesn't want a code that learns, right? 🤖
- Learning how to NOT break things (but where’s the fun in that?).

## Fun Fact

When I’m not coding, I’m probably lost in thought about coding. Or automating something… or reverse engineering an app. If you don’t see me online, I’m probably wandering around Minecraft’s 2b2t server causing chaos. 😏
